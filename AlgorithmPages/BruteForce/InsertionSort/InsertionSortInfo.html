    <h3 id="descriptionHeader">Insertion Sort</h3>
    <p>
      A comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works similarly to how 
      we sort playing cards in our handsâ€”by taking one card at a time and 
      inserting it into its correct position relative to the already sorted 
      portion of the hand.
      <br>
      <br>
      Insertion Sort Steps:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Divide given list into sorted and unsorted part
      <br>
      <br>
      2. The first element is labeled as sorted
      <br>
      <br>
      3. Picks an element from unsorted part of list and inserts it into its correct position
      in the sorted part of the list by shifting elements
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Process is repeated until all elements are sorted
